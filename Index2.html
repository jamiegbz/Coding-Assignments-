    <!--Gave a small summary on information about dogs.
    Depending on what dog one gets they will either be high or low energty. 
    One should pick the best breed that best fits their lifestyle.-->
        <p>Depending what dog breed you get will depend on how their energy leveks are and as well as their size.
        Chose a dog that will best fit your lifestyle, and where you live. 
        Small dogs will do great living in a small space, 
        but larger dogs will need spaces to run around, so lots of backyard space!
